# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported versions of this project are the current versions of the `develop` and `master` branches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report potential vulnerabilities via email to CTS@gordon.edu and include "Potential 360 security vulnerability" in the subject.

We will endeavor to respond to any reported vulnerabilities in a timely fashion. 
We may decline vulnerabilities if we deem them invalid, for example if the vulnerability would only apply to 
using a dependency in a Node.js environment which we do not do. If accepted, the vulnerability will be addressed by our team and we will update you on our progress. 
Thank you for your assistance in keeping our corner of the internet safe.
